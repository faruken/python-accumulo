# Introduction

**WIP**

This is a [thrift](https://thrift.apache.org/) generated Python 3 client library for [Apache Accumulo](https://accumulo.apache.org/).


Thrift code is generated with `thrift -r --gen py proxy.thrift` of Accumulo 1.8.1.

#### Notes
pyaccumulo doesn't support Python 3 and I'm not sure if it's still maintained so I've created a new one.
